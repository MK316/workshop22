Ch01,P1,"Before the age of the smartphone, aspiring photographers had to learn how to use high-tech cameras and photographic techniques. Not everyone had cameras, and it took skill and a good eye to capture and create a great photograph. Today, with the huge range of camera apps on our smartphones, we are all amateur photographers. And pretty good ones, too: The quality of smartphone images now nearly equals that of digital cameras."
Ch01,P2,"The new ease of photography has given us a tremendous appetite for capturing the magical and the ordinary. We are obsessed with documenting everyday moments, whether it’s a shot of our breakfast, our cat – or our cat’s breakfast. And rather than collect pictures in scrapbooks, we share, like, and comment on them with friends and strangers around the globe."
Ch01,P3,Even photojournalists are experimenting with cell phones because their near invisibility makes it easier to capture unguarded media. They can now act as their own publishers – reaching huge audiences via social media sites such as Instagram. A photograph taken in New York can get a response from someone in Lagos within a second of being uploaded.
Ch01,P4,"In the past, magazines published unforgettable photos of important people and global events that captured our imaginations. These photos had the power to change public opinion – even the course of history. But if there are fewer memorable images today, it’s not because there are fewer good images: It’s because there are so many. No one image gets to be special for long."
Ch01,P5,"Cameras are everywhere – a situation that is transforming the way we experience dramatic events. When there are major political events or natural disasters, it is ordinary citizens with cell phones – not photojournalists – who often provide the first news images. Quality still matters, but it’s less important than what’s instantly shared."
Ch01,P6,"As people everywhere embrace photography and the media make use of citizen journalist, professional standards appear to be shifting. In the past, most people trusted photojournalists to accurately represent reality. Today, however, digital images can be altered in ways the naked eye might never notice. Any image can be altered to create an “improved” picture of reality. The average viewer is left with no way to assess the accuracy of an image except through trust in a news organization or photographer."
Ch02,P1,"The ability of some species to create light, known as bioluminescence, is both magical and commonplace. Magical, because of its glimmering beauty. Commonplace, because many life forms can do it. On land the most familiar examples are fireflies, flashing to attract mates on a warm summer night. But there are other luminous land organisms, including glow-worms, millipedes, and some ninety species of fungus. Even some birds, such as the Atlantic puffin, have beaks that glow in the dark."
Ch02,P2,"But the real biological light show takes place in the sea. Here, an astonishing number of beings can make light. Some, such as ostracods, are like ocean fireflies, using flashes of light to attract mate. There are also glowing bacteria, and light-making fish, squid, and jellyfish. Indeed, of all the groups of organisms known to make light, more than four-fifths live in the ocean."
Ch02,P3,"As a place to live, the ocean has a couple of peculiarities. Firstly, there is almost nowhere to hide, so being invisible is very important. Secondly, as you descend, sunlight disappears. At first, red light is absorbed. Then the yellow and green parts of the spectrum disappear, leaving just the blue. At two-hundred meters below the surface, the ocean becomes a kind of perpetual twilight, and at six-hundred meters the blue fades out too. In fact, most of the ocean is as black as the night sky. These factors make light uniquely useful as a weapon or a veil."
Ch02,P4,"In the ocean’s upper layers, where light penetrates, creatures need to blend in to survive. Any life form that stands out is in danger of being spotted by predators, especially those swimming below, looking up. Many life forms solve this problem by avoiding the light zone during the day. Others, such as jellyfish and swimming snails, are transparent, ghostlike creatures, almost impossible to see."
Ch02,P5,"Other sea species use light to survive in the upper layers, but how? Some, such as certain shrimp and squid, illuminate their bellies to match the light coming from above. This allows them to become invisible to predators below. Their light can be turned on and off at will, some even have a dimmer switch. For example, certain types of shrimp can alter how much light they give off, depending on the brightness of the water around them. If a cloud passes overhead and briefly blocks the light, the shrimp will dim itself accordingly."
Ch02,P6,"But if the aim is to remain invisible, why do some creatures light up when they are touched, or when the water nearby is disturbed? A couple of reasons. First, a sudden burst of light may startle a predator, giving the prey a chance to escape. Some kinds of deep-sea squid, for example, give a big squirt of light before darting off into the gloom."
Ch05,P1,"Second, there is the principle of ‘the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Giving off light can help summon the predator of your predator. Known as the burglar alarm effect, this is especially useful for tiny life forms, such as dinoflagellates, that cannot swim fast. For such small beings, water is too viscous to allow a quick getaway, it would be like trying to swim through syrup. Instead, when threatened by a shrimp, for example, these organisms light up. The flashes attract larger fish that are better able to spot, and eat, the shrimp. The chief defense for these tiny organisms is therefore not fight or flight, but light. "
Ch05,P2,"Everybody loves a good story, and when it's finished, this may be the greatest one ever told.
It begins in Africa with a group of people.
There are perhaps just a few hundred, surviving by hunting animals and gathering fruits, vegetables, and nuts.
It ends about 200,000 years later, with their seven billion descendants spread across the Earth."
Ch05,P3,"In between is an exciting tale of survival, movement, isolation, and conquest, most of it occurring before recorded history.
Who were those first modern people in Africa?
What routes did they take when they left their home continent to expand into Europe and Asia?
When and how did humans reach the Americas?
For decades, the only proof was found in a small number of scattered bones and artifacts that our ancestors had left behind.
In the past 20 years, however, DNA technologies have allowed scientists to find a record of ancient human migrations in the DNA of living people."
Ch05,P4,"""Every drop of human blood contains a history book written in the language of our genes,"" says population geneticist Spencer Wells.
The human genetic code, or genome, is 99.9 percent identical throughout the world.
The bulk of our DNA is the same.
However, the remainder is responsible for our individual differences -- in eye color or disease risk, for example.
On very rare occasions, a small change -- called a mutation -- can occur.
This can then be passed down to all of that person's descendants.
Generations later, finding that same mutation in two people's DNA indicates that they share the same ancestor.
By comparing mutations in many different populations, scientists can trace their ancestral connections."
Ch05,P5,"These ancient mutations are easiest to tract in two places.
One is in DNA that is passed from mother to child (called mitochondrial DNA, or mtDNA).
The other is in DNA that travels from father to son (known as the Y chromosome, the part of DNA that determines a child will be a boy).
By comparing the mtDNA and Y chromosomes of people from various populations, geneticists can get a rough idea of where and when those groups separated in the great migrations around the planet."
Ch05,P6,"In the mid-1980s, a study compared mtDNA from people around the world.
It found that people of African descent had twice as many genetic differences from each other than did others.
Because mutations seem to occur at a steady rate over time, scientists concluded that modern humans must have lived in Africa at least twice as long as anywhere else."
