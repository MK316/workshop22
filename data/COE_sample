The Association is an academic society which aims to contribute to the development of
English-language abilities through research and education. The role of the Association's
members (hereinafter, "Members") is to broaden their knowledge of professional
English education and to demonstrate their knowledge and capability of improvement of
the English skills of all types of learners. The Association's Code of Ethics
(hereinafter, "the Code") prescribes the principles and standards that Members,
as educators, must comply with while doing research and academic activities.
In pursuing academic activities and the publication of academic research,
Members must abide by the Code, fulfill their duties as researchers,
acknowledge one another's research, and share the results of their work.
Publication in academic journals impartially selecting and publishing
strictly evaluated papers on English education is one of the most important goals of
the Association. In order to ensure responsible publication in well-respected academic journals,
 thereby making a contribution towards English education development, it is necessary
 to establish the Code for authors and the Association's Editors and Judges to follow.
Although our organization has long had a general and practical code of ethics, this Code,
established to meet the expectations of changing times that now require a more explicit code
of ethics, will become a foundation to reconfirm the ethical mandate that the Association
intends to apply in all aspects of its operation.
